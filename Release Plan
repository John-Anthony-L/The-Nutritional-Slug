HIGH LEVEL GOALS: 
- Ability to type in a type of food (i.e. pasta, dairy, bread, etc), specifying what macros to choose (Proteins, Carbs, and Fats) and select a food product 
with those macros selected.
- This will return a list of recommended brands/food items which are more in line with your focus as well as not being too calorie-dense
- Gives you a report on your total progress, and a pie chart breaking down your current food intake, including the number of calories per day, as well
 as your macro goal and how close you are to reaching it.
- Have a personal “diary” of each day’s chosen food
- prototype testing, continuous integration 

USER STORY FOR RELEASE:
Sprint 1:
(8?) User story 1: As a health conscious user, I want to optimize a selected food to fit their macros so that I can eat the healthiest option available **Should we revise this to instead aim for making a simple query for a product through the API? Rather than doing the actual calculations for the healthiest option**
(5?) User story 2: As a user of the app itself, I want to be able to easily navigate through an intuitive user interface.
Sprint 2:
(8?) User story 1: As a health conscious user, I want to be able to calculate the Macros based on personal goals and current weight so that I know exactly what I macro I have to cut down on. 
Sprint 3:
(story points) User story 1: As a user trying to see health changes, I wants to see progress and daily meal plan/diary so that I can stay motivated. 

Product backlog:
