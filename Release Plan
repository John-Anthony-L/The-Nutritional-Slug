- If Connecting to Amazon, then puts into a list for shopping cart
- If Spoonacular then perhaps find a way to get the nearest store with the selected item, (perhaps integrated google maps [super stretch goal])
- Gives you a report on your total progress, and a pie chart breaking down your current food intake, including the number of calories per day, as well as your macro goal and how close you are to reaching it.
- Have a personal “diary” of each day’s chosen food

continuous integration, and website must be included)
