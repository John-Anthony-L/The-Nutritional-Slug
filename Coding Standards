1. Proper Intendation
2. Use proper Variables and not just 1 letters, Make the name descriptive.
3. Use Swift types whenever possible (Array, Dictionary, Set, String, etc.) as opposed to the NS*
4. Whenever possible use let instead of var.
5. Open curly braces on the next line as the statement and close on a new line.
6. Don't add empty lines after opening braces or before closing braces.
7. Make all colons left-hugging (no space before but a space after) except when used with the ternary operator (a space both before and after).
8. Don't put multiple statements on one line
9. For single conditional statements, do not use parentheses.
10. Use parentheses around compound conditional statements for clarity or to make the order of operations explicit.
11. break is not needed between case statements 
12. Except where necessary, avoid using self.. If you have a local variable that conflicts with a property name or are in a context where self is captured, you may need to use self..
13. Remove return types of Void and parentheses around single input parameters. This is especialy relevant if the closure takes no input and returns no output.
14. make your code compile without warnings.
15. Unused (dead) code, including Xcode template code and placeholder comments should be removed
16. Parentheses around conditionals are not required and should be omitted.
