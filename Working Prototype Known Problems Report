List of suggested user stories/acceptance criteria for actual acceptance test:

  - As a user I want to:
  
      - Search for a food product and choose between brands based on their macros
          -> Functional search returns list of brands
          -> Tapping a brand expands to show show macros
          -> Pressing "Back" saves my choice
          
      - Be able to intuitively navigate between pages in the app
          -> Tabs at the bottom of the screen for each page
          -> First time user is automatically taken to the settings page
          
      - Input my statistics and have the app calculate my macro goals based on my current weight to find out my target macro intake
          -> Functional settings page
          -> Integrate a macro calculator based on a person's age, height, weight, and daily exercise
          
      - See a log of the brands I have chosen to eat for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner today
          -> Choosing a food for a meal saves that food under the appropriate meal in the today page
          
      - Enter a custom food item instead of searching for a brand
          -> Tapping on the meals in the today page brings up a custom food page
          -> Allow user to input food name and macros (through sliders)
          
      - See how a chosen food affects my progress towards my macro goals
          -> When I choose a food, through either the search or custom page, the macros are sent to the today page
          -> When macros are sent to the today page, they are added towards the macro goal for that day
          -> This progress is shown visually through bar graphs
