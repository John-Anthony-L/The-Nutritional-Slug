product name: The Nutritional Slug
Team Name: Gold Team 
Project Owner: John Lara 
Scrum Master: Roberto Oregon
Developers: Sanyam Sachdeva, Vidisha Nevatia, Dylan Salak
sprint completion date: Monday, June 6, 2020
revision number: 0 
revision date: - 

GOAL: - create a user friendly UI that allows for clean and simple searching
     - API database access and relevant utilization (i.e., donâ€™t give the user ALL the information about a product, just the relevant stuff like selected macros)


Task listing, organized by user story:

(8) User story 1: As a health conscious user, I want to search for a food product that fits my macros so that I know the variety I can choose from and eat the 
healthiest option available

Task 1: (1) BUILD A SEARCH FUNCTION
Task 2: (3) CONNECT TO THE API
Task 3: (3) FILTER OUT IRRELEVANT DATA
Task 4: (1) LIST PRODUCTS WITH THEIR RELEVANT DATA, DISPLAY ALL PRODUCTS IN 100g increments with serving size in parenthesis
-- EX: frozen strawberry 100g (140g serving size)
          1g protein
          8g carb
          0g fat
Task 5: (0) DEFAULT SORT ON CALORIE

Total for user story 1: 16 hours

(5) User story 2: As a user of the app itself, I want to be able to easily navigate through an intuitive user interface so that I know where to search for food, 
look at my progress, see my daily nutritional goals, and to be able to calculate my required macronutrients.
Task 1: (2) MULTIPLE SKETCH DESIGNS FOR UI ( we're thinking having a home page, with sections you can select and then the page moves to that selection)
Task 2: (1) COLOR SCHEME(S)
Task 3: (1) CREATE SECTIONS FOR MACRO CALCULATION, FOOD DAILY DIARY ( breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), FOOD SEARCH, MACRO OVERVIEW ( pie chart) 
Task 4: (1) GROUP DECISION ON UI

Total for user story 2: 10 hours
