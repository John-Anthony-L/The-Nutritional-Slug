Work Completed/ Not completed -  
1. STORY 1: As a health conscious user, I want to search for a food product that fits my macros so that I know the variety I can choose from and eat the healthiest option available
2. STORY 2: As a user of the app itself, I want to be able to easily navigate through an intuitive user interface so that I know where to search for food, look at my progress, see my daily nutritional goals, and to be able to calculate my required macronutrients.
